# Case Database

A WPF sample project that demonstrates some common WPF features:
- Using app resources (from external xaml files).
- Using Styles.
- Doing animations using storyboards and easing functions.
- Custom user controls with events.
- Using custom value converters.
- Data templates.

This project is an ode to old-school, over-the-top "CIA Terminal" screens used in movies. It has a login screen with flashing red "Access Denied" warning, and a case database with "suspect" photos and background information (WIP).

Data access is faked, as the goal of this project was purely to demo UI features.
